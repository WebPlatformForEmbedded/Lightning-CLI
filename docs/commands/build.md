# Build command

_Build a local development version of the Lightning App_

```bash
lng build -e <env>
```

The `lng build` command is used to build a version of your App targetted at _local development_.

The built App will be created in the `build` folder inside your App folder.

_Note that in older versions of the Lightning-CLI (< 1.6.0) the build command would create the built App version in the `dist` folder)_

The App version generated by the `lng build` command is intended to simulate the Metrological AppStore during local development.
For example, it loads the appBundle asynchronously and makes an API request to`settings.<env>.json` used for App configuration, similar
to the boot process of the Metrological AppStore.

The `-e <env>` will help you to choose what environment will use to generate the build. You can have multiple settings files, one for every environment.

By default you will use the `dev` environment (development).

With the `-e` flag you choose what setting file will use to build your application. Examples:

- `lng build -e dev` will use `settings.dev.json`
- `lng build -e prod` will use `settings.prod.json`
- `lng build -e test` will use `settings.test.json`

If you want to use your app _outside_ the context of the Metrological AppStore, you might also be interested in the [`lng dist`](commands/dist.md) command.

_**Note**: Run this command in the root folder of your Lightning App_
